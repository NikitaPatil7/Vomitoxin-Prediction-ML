# Vomitoxin-Prediction-ML
This project predicts vomitoxin levels using spectral data and machine learning. It includes data preprocessing, PCA for dimensionality reduction, and a Random Forest model for predictions. Performance is evaluated using MAE, MSE, and RÂ² scores. Future improvements include hyperparameter tuning and testing alternative models.
